# Installation

- Point to the configuration
  ```
  ln -s ~/SharedEnvironment/fish ~/.config/fish
  ```
- MacOS - Add `/usr/local/bin/fish` to `/etc/shells`

# Prompt Handling

- `iterm2` doesn't handle all unicode characters (emoji's) correctly so limited to known working characters (e.g. chipmunk)
